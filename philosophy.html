		Long ago, when computer programming first came to be, machines had to be
		programmed quite manually. If the technician entered the correct
		sequence of machine codes in the correct order, then the resulting
		program behavior would satisfy the business requirements.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then we invented a higher-level programming language: C. And once more,
		if the programmer wrote the correct sequence of instructions in the
		correct order, then the resulting program behavior would satisfy the
		business requirements.
	</p>

		The 1980's: A Revolution in Software
	</h1>
	<p>
		The 1980's saw the invention of a new way to write computer programs:
		object-oriented programming. The programmer would write code that
		manipulated the data belonging to re-usable "objects", and if the
		programmer wrote the correct instructions in the correct order, then the
		resulting program behavior would satisfy the business requirements.
	</p>
	<p>
		After that, things got pretty boring.

		Most modern programming today is <em>basically imperative</em>, meaning
		it models the traditional fetch-execute cycle of a CPU. Perform an
		instruction, fetch the next one. Perform that one, and so on. For
		decades, programmers have had to mould their brains to fit the paradigm
		of the CPU.
	</p>
	<h1 class="emph alert">
		Imperative Programming is Dangerous
	</h1>
	<p>
		When we rely on hoping that the behavior that emerges from a program is
		correct, and that reliance is based on nothing more than a programmer's
		correctness, then we can easily find ourselves in a <a
		href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25">sticky situation</a>. We
		can try and mitigate the costs of imperative programming with things
		like unit tests or integration tests, but why mitigate the costs when
		there's a better way?
	</p>
	<p>
		Instead of telling a computer <em>how</em> to do its job, why don't we
		just tell it <em>what</em> its job is and let it figure the rest out?
		The bottom line is imperative programming is error-prone and relies too
		heavily on the infallibility of the programmer.

		Functional Reactive Programming
	</h1>
	<p>
		Functional. Reactive. Programming. What on Earth is that?
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, we know to some degree what functional programming is. Functions
		don't have side-effects; there's no mutable state. It's a difficult way
		to program since the real world is mutable. Modelling things like user
		input becomes a nightmare.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Reactive</em> programming? What's that? Well, the best way to
		describe reactive programming is to think of a spreadsheet. Imagine
		three cells, A, B, and C. A is defined as the sum of B and C. Whenever B
		or C changes, A <em>reacts</em> to update itself. That's reactive
		programming: changes propagate throughout a system automatically.
	</p>
	<!-- TODO: Spreasheet image -->
	<p>
		Functional reactive programming is just a combination of functional and
		reactive paradigms. We model user input as a function that changes over
		time, abstracting away the idea of mutable state.
	</p>
	<p>
		Functional reactive programming is the peanut butter and chocolate of
		programming paradigms.
	</p>

<section class="content">
	<p>
		At the core of functional reactive programming is a <em>signal</em>. A
		signal is a rather abstract concept, and it's easier to describe what a
		signal does rather than what it is. A signal simply <em>sends values
		over time</em>. It sends values until it either completes, or errors
		out, at which point it stops sending values forever. A signal either
		completes or errors out, but not both.
	</p>
	<p>
		Signals have no sense of a "current value" or "past values" or "future
		values", they are very simple. They just send values over time. Signals
		become useful when they're subscribed to or used with bindings, both
		cases of which we'll cover shortly. For now, it's important to
		understand that a signal can be <em>transformed</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		If I have a signal that sends numbers, and I want it to send strings
		instead, I can easily <em>transform</em> that signal with a
		<em>map</em>. A map is an <em>operator</em> that takes in a signal as a
		receiver, performs some operation on the values sent over that signal,
		and generates a new signal with the new, mapped values.
	</p>
	<p>
		A signal can be <em>subscribed to</em> in order to perform side-effects.
		A good example would be the signal emitted by a button when it's
		pressed; we can subscribe to that signal in order to perform side
		effects. A signal can also be <em>bound</em> to a property. For example,
		a signal that sends the location of a gesture recognizer can be mapped
		to a color and bound to the background color of a view. Then, when the
		user changes their tap position, the view changes color.
	</p>
	<p>
		Both of these examples, of subscription and binding, demonstrate that we
		can create a set up at the beginning of an application runtime and tell
		the code <em>what to do</em> without telling it <em>how to do it</em>.
		This is the value of functional reactive programming.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another core concept in functional reactive programming is that of
		<em>derived state</em>. State is OK in ReactiveCocoa, as long as its
		<em>bound</em> to a signal. This derived state means that you never
		explicitly set the value of a bound property, but rather rely on signal
		transformations to derive that state for you.

		ReactiveCocoa is an implementation of functional reactive programming
		that is built on top of the Cocoa and CocoaTouch libraries that you're
		already familiar with.
